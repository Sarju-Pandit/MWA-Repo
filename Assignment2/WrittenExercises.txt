1) Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Ans: 

setImmediate checks queue of I/O eventhandlers. If all I/O events in the current snapshot 
are processed, it executes the callback. It queues them immedieately after the last I/O
handler. So it is faster.

Whereas setTimeout is simply like calling the function after delay has finished. Whenever 
a function is called it is not executed immediately, but queued so that it is executed
after all the executing and currently queued eventhandlers finish first. It checks 
the timer at least once before executing the call back even it has been set to 0 
millisecond delay(setTimeout(,0)).

So, if we have to do some processes after I/O, we can use setImmediate.


2) Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate.
Ans: 
process.nextTick is a priority queue. It is uesd to effectively queue the function at the head 
of the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current function completes.Whereas 
setImmediate is used if we want to queue the function behind whatever I/O event callbacks that 
are already in the event queue. Callbacks queued by setImmediate will be called after I/O events.
